# Image Classification

This repository contains a basic image classification model designed to classify images into three categories: Cats, Horses, and Puppies. The project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to build and train a neural network for image recognition.

The code includes preprocessing steps, model training, and prediction functionalities, making it a simple yet effective example of image classification.

## Features
- Preprocessing and resizing of input images.
- A convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification.
- Training, validation, and prediction functionalities.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (for image handling)
